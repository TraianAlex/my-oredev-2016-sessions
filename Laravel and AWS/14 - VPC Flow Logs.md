# VPC Flow Logs

*Tip* - [VPC Flow logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html), like CloudTrail, can help you figure out what's going on.

I've got nothing. I just found out about this recently. but this kinda sells me on the feature.

>Flow logs can help you with a number of tasks; for example, to troubleshoot why specific traffic is not reaching an instance, which in turn can help you diagnose overly restrictive security group rules. You can also use flow logs as a security tool to monitor the traffic that is reaching your instance.
