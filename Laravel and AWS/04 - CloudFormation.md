# CloudFormation

/Heuristic/ - Unless you build everything out as code, special snowflakes will form

This is a pain in the butt to have to back port into production. Or you are going to have to do it in parallel which costs, well, double. So just start from the beginning building everything via CloudFormation -- especially your VPC and Subnets.
